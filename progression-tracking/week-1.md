*Disclaimer: As Mojo creators stated, "This document captures our broad plan about how we plan to stage things...[it] can also be seen as an acknowledgement of major missing components that we know do not exist in the current system which we plan to add" [1]. This insight reinforces why this progression tracking sheet aims exclusively at offering inspiration rather than strict guidance while exploring new horizons with Mojo- it is still under early development, leaving more ground to cover down the line.

*Thus, understand there may indeed lead some unforeseeable gaps through completing every topic on this checklist or even render elements obsolete by technology advancing. Retain an open mindset towards maintaining flexible enough throughout your Mojo learning expedition!
