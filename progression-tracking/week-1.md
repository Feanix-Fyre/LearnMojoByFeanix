Personal Note:
So if you know what you're doing, you'll probably be wondering why we're starting at our foundations. And if you're wondering why we're starting with the foundations, then you and I have two different ways of seeing the world. I'm gonna leave it at that.

To everyone else, welcome. Let me know how to be better.
